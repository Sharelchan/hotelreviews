Bayview Hotel Georgetown,RM 327,Very good,"""1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk,  street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road!
Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang.

The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!).

We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning.
And were we glad we did. 

We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you!
Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up"""
Flamingo Hotel by the Beach,RM 583,Very good,"""I travel to Penang frequently, it can be difficult to find a descent hotel there, they are either extremely expensive or not very nice. Many hotels in Penang are horribly run often with my bare minimum of a clean room not being met, and often the staff can be downright miserable. But the Flamingo is the exception. The have clean, nice rooms and a friendly staff. The pool and pool bar are very relaxing, the bar tender is friendly and makes a great pina colada. The breakfast is the best I have found in Penang even at much pricier resorts. The location is great. Far from the airport but, central to Georgetown and Batu Ferringhi."""
Bayview Beach Resort,RM 538,Excellent,"""bayview beach resort penang hotel, a member of bayview international hotels and resorts is located on the beachfront on the north-west coast of penang island. the resort overlooks the tranquil and scenic bay of the ""foreigner's rock"" or batu ferringhi.it is 18 km or 20 minutes from georgetown and 33 km or 45 minutes from penang  international airport."""
Hotel Sentral Seaview Penang @ Beachfront,RM 314,Very good,"""I stayed for one night, and ive been to a lot of hotels in penang but i can guarantee you its the best hotel i have ever stay! Beats all the 4/5 star hotels! The room is so clean and beautiful, with a sea view.The staff is very attentive and friendly. The breakfast buffet is delicious too! I would definitely choose this hotel for my next visit"""
Rainbow Paradise Beach Resort,RM 266,Very good,"""This hotel/resort is the best value for money hotel in Penang. We paid half the price of hotels in Batu Ferringhi but certainly received far far better than half the value. The hotel is brilliantly located at Tanjung Bungha, halfway between Georgetown and Batu Ferringhi with the regular air conditioned rapid bus service travelling in both directions. [Georgetown RM2 & Batu Ferringhi RM1.40]. The suite we had was fantastic with views over both the bay and the hills.The pool area is terrific and the beach is good with all water sports at your disposal.We have now stayed at this hotel twice [having previously stayed at Batu Ferringhi 3 times] and we will be returning to Paradise Sandy Bay Beach Resort for our third stay in October."""
Pearl View Hotel,RM 224,Very good,"""Nice and clean superior room.Warm welcome by hotel receptionist.A few minutes drive to Penang island across Penang Bridge.At night you can enjoy the best Charles Kuey Tiau mee at Sungai Dua closed at about 2 am.Mee Udang (Prawn mee) also famous here.The hotel under renovation and let enjoy staying here. Hope to come again"""
Evergreen Laurel Hotel,RM 429,Excellent,"""One of the best hotels in Penang. Hotel is quite old nut you don't feel it at all as it well maintained and kept by staff. Location is really best near to Gurty walk with easy access to all the well known locations of the island. Car park is quite comfortable and there is always available parking bay. """
