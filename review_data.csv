Aayu Chulia,Malaysia,9.5,"Aayu Chulia was the perfect stay in Georgetown. 
The location was great, right in the middle of the main area of the city. The rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms. Nice shared social space on the ground floor. It also had filtered water and the daily bread from the local bakery was a lovely touch. 
We also got a lot of helpful recommendations from the hotel, which made the experience extra special. 
Would 100% recommend."

Wink at McCallum Street,Singapore,7.9,"Staff was very kind and helpful. I saw them clean when they had a chance throughout the day. The place was nearby so many places like the nice hawker centre that was across from it. There are coffee and tea shops right across from the place and a 7-11 right next to it. The staff is patient with anything that happens. Subway station is a short walk away. 
The place was reasonable for the price, would come here again if I needed a short stay. 
Easily accessible if you use their transport service from Changi airport and tell them the address of the place."
